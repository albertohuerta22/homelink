# HomeLink

HomeLink is a web application designed to centralize resources for the local unhoused community. With a user-friendly interface, users can easily access information about local shelters, weather updates, available resources, news, and emergency contacts in New York City.

## Status

The project is currently in progress.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend: [React](https://reactjs.org/)

- The frontend of HomeLink is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a modular and efficient way to create interactive UI components.

### Backend: [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)

- HomeLink's backend is powered by Spring Boot, a Java-based framework for building web applications and microservices. Spring Boot simplifies the development process with its convention-over-configuration approach and built-in features for rapid application development.

### Caching with [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine)

- Caching is implemented using Caffeine, a high-performance in-memory caching library for Java. This helps improve the performance and scalability of the application by reducing the need to repeatedly fetch data from external sources.

### Dependency Management with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

- Maven is used for managing project dependencies and building the application. It provides a consistent and reliable way to manage project dependencies, ensuring that all required libraries are easily accessible and up-to-date.

### Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/)

- Hibernate, an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java, is used for mapping Java objects to database tables. This simplifies database interactions and reduces the amount of boilerplate code required for data persistence.

## Backend Versions

- Note that there are two versions of the backend for this project. Further details on the differences between these versions can be found in the respective backend README files.

## Deployment

- [Deployment instructions will be added once the project reaches a stable state.]
